Conway's Game of Life - Multiplayer

A special take on Conway's Game of Life. It has multiplayer capabilities, a progressive web app client and it can run on the "Medienfassade" (a big projection area visible from the street) of my university.

People can visit the app on their phone (or desktop), read up on the rules, place some cells and then see the events unfold on the screen.

Uses socket.io for communication, Node for the game server and p5.js for displaying the graphics.
